NBFM Receiver designed for HackRF ONE

A quick and easy NBFM receiver designed for HackRF ONE using GNU Radio Companion 3.7.11.1. The settings 
in this project have only been tested using HackRF One, and should be changed if you are using another 
device. I am new to SDR and I am just adding this project for beginners. This project has been tested under 
Ubuntu and Windows. I get better results using GNU Radio under Windows because I have not figured 
out issues with ALSA and GNU Radio operating on Linux.
